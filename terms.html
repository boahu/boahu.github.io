      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026-02-23</p>

      <p>
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the ParkRelay mobile app and related services
        (collectively, the “Service”). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree,
        do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>1) Pilot scope (New York City)</h2>
      <p>
        ParkRelay is currently operated as a city-by-city pilot. The primary pilot city is <strong>New York City</strong>.
        The Service may restrict or disable features outside the pilot area(s). We may change pilot scope or availability
        at any time.
      </p>

      <h2>2) What ParkRelay is (and is not)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ParkRelay helps coordinate real-time parking handoffs</strong> between drivers (“Leavers” and “Hunters”).</li>
        <li><strong>No guarantee:</strong> ParkRelay does not guarantee a parking spot, availability, timing, or successful handoff.</li>
        <li><strong>No payments / no selling:</strong> ParkRelay is not a marketplace for selling or reserving parking spots.
          Users must not request or offer money, tips, or compensation through the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>No affiliation:</strong> ParkRelay is not affiliated with the City of New York or any government agency.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) Safety and lawful use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drive safely:</strong> You are responsible for safe driving and obeying all traffic and parking laws.</li>
        <li><strong>No distracted driving:</strong> Do not use ParkRelay while driving if it distracts you. Pull over safely if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow signage and rules:</strong> You are responsible for tickets, towing, fines, or enforcement actions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you are under 18, you must have permission
        from a parent or legal guardian to use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>5) Accounts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You may need to create an account or sign in to use certain features.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account access and for activities under your account.</li>
        <li>You agree to provide accurate information and keep it updated.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6) Acceptable use (what you must not do)</h2>

        <li>Do not harass, threaten, impersonate, or stalk other users.</li>
        <li>Do not submit false signals, spam, or abusive reports.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>7) Location and notifications</h2>
      <p>
        ParkRelay uses location services to support geo-gating, matching, ETA/routing, and proximity confirmation during
        an active handoff. Notifications may be used for time-sensitive pilot events (assignment/cancellation/proximity alerts).
        If you deny permissions, core pilot features may not work.
      </p>

        See the <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details on how we handle data.

      <h2>8) Service changes, suspension, and termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service (in whole or part) at any time.
        We may suspend or terminate your access if we reasonably believe you violated these Terms, abused the Service,
        or created risk/harm to other users or the community.
      </p>

      <h2>9) Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>

      <h2>10) Third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        The Service may rely on third-party providers (for example, hosting, authentication, routing/ETA, and notifications).
        We are not responsible for third-party services and they may be governed by their own terms and policies.
      </p>

      <h2>11) Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
        WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, or that any parking handoff
        will be successful.
      </p>

        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PARKRELAY WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
